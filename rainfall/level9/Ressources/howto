looks like we can put some data on heap, the cool thing would be to override
the pointer called at the end of main towards heap, there we would place a
shellcode and we win

we can see that 1st arg of program segfaults with more than 108 chars
which is a size for new N instances we can find back in asm

mmmh for some reason the nop slide stops prgm exec so the shellcode doesnt get exec
see scipt.py vs script2.py. it works in gdb though, weird
