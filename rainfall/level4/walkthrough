## Exploit type: Format string exploit to modify variable value

kindof the same thing as previous level, except there is a restriction in fgets,
we cant print more than 512 chars. We can use a trick of printf format type to print
characters with printf without typing them all into standard input

BUT, we can do an other quite neat trick to avoir printing 0x1025544 chars,
what we can do is to try do two writes with printf with writing 2 upper bytes
and 2 lower bytes of the required variable. Check exploit.py
