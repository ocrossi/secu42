## Exploit type: buffer overflow to redirect code exec

in gdb
info function gives us the address of run function

then classic bufferoverflow where we override gets return address on stack
with run address to redirect code execution
1st calculate offset, here 76, then add to a 76 char padding the address
of run function with bytes in reverse order to respect endianness
We see the "Good... Wait what?" and a whoami indicates we changed user

Last thing, since level1 reads on stdin, we have to do a sort of trick to keep
level1 running, else the program would stop immediately.
So put exploit in file then cat file - | ./level1 to keep lv1 from shutting down



echo $(python -c 'print 76 * "A" + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"') > /tmp/exploit !! be carefull endianness
