##Exploit type: buffer overflow with shellcode to insert own instructions
				into vulnerable program

in gdb
info functions shows us a gets in function p
we think using bufferoverflow. No place in the code to give us a convenient
privilege escalation, so we insert our own. We would be able to redirect code exec
to the stack where gets writes our input, but a if makes sure that we dont override return
address with an address belonging to the stack. But we have a strdup that writes user input
on heap
So the idea is to override return address with address where strdup writes user input
