looked like it was so simple buffer overflow,
1st param negative would overflow in main and
memcpy something really big
or we could learn how to do short jump to pass
the 4bytes pack containing eip adress and voila
could we modify shellcode like bosses?
operation short jump would work, we have to get eip
at last instruction, add size of instruction to short jump
+ padding

like EB 4 car eip se situe a la fin de jump
