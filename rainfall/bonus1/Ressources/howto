looked like it was so simple buffer overflow,
1st param negative would overflow in main and
memcpy something really big
or we could learn how to do short jump to pass
the 4bytes pack containing eip adress and voila
could we modify shellcode like bosses?
operation short jump would work, we have to get eip
at last instruction, add size of instruction to short jump
+ padding

like EB 4 car eip se situe a la fin de jump, to try for prev lv


in the end there is in the code a call to bin/sh
the purpose of the level is to pass in the wanted if by rewritting a value on stack
problem we need 44 bytes of input to override the value we want
we can overflow with close to min int to get the value we want
since the pprgm multiplies value by 4 
so with min int we see ecx at 4 in the call to memcpy
by fiddling around a little we can get with input 1 as -2147483637
ecx            0x2c	44
we have room, now 2nd arg should be 40 padding plus value we want
