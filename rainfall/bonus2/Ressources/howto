sooo

we have some env language var from terminal  that will change if nl or fi
we have a bufferoverflow with 40 A 40 bs before call to greetuser.
eip seems to be overwritten wit 2 bs just after memcpy in call to greetuser
hehe if we go to nl we can override eip completetly thus taking control of code
exec
NETHERLANDS + SHELLCODE
