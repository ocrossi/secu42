## Exploit type : use after free

we have a program with 4 ifs where we can enter commands in standard input
auth
login
service

there is a problem in size of variables on stack. service auth and login except pointers,
and we can input a service that overflows on stack causing control variables to not be 0
anymore and skip authentication

so ./level8
auth admin
service AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
login

we in
as i understood overflow on service expecting a pointer allows us to login with password
