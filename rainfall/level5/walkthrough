## Exploit type : format string exploit to override instruction pointer on stack,
					so redirecting code exec

this level is a format string vulnerability like level 3 and 4, but with the
goal to rewrite a global offset table value to smash the return of exit function
to the o function.

1st we have to define which param we control in the vulnerable printf: 4th param
then we need 2 adresses: address of jump value to exit function in got and adress of
the function we want to go to

then we need to perform a printf wiht %n and write number of chars to match the address of
the function we want to go to

little trick there, to write this address we perform 2 writes instead of one, to avoid printing
over 134 millions chars to screen. the write of the 2 most significant bytes is a bit tricky,
it depends on the 2 less significant bytes of the previous 4 bytes group. Some hex arithmetic
can solve this problem easily
