seems like a buffer overflow with 2 separate inputs
i cant segfault if at least input size 1 20 and input2
16 chars.
we acn take control of the eip of main to redirect prgm exec into
a shellcode we would place on stack

last thing is to determine how exactly the 2 inputs are processed 
by the program

we can see whatever the length of 1st arg only 20 chars are copied 
(and same for 2nd one?)

the exploit should look like 

[shellcode] 	[padding] 	[address to beginning of shellcode]
21		15		4

doesnt work on main stack cause space boring in between
we can try using main saved eip to jump onto the read part
plus address is offset +9 beginning 2nd  arg

so nop slide, shellcode 1st arg
2nd arg is 9 bytes addr shellcode and 7 more bytes
 + for some reason offset mini is beginning of shellcode + 64

this level was so boring to debug
